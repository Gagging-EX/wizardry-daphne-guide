### Forbidden Area Search Escort

You have to find an old mage three times, answer a trivia question and fight a battle each time. When you return to the guild (which happens automatically after the third encounter) Endy asks you a final question. The answer determines whether you get the bond or not.

    - MORLIS
    - Level drain
    - Opening the gate

    !!! note
        If you answer one of the old mage’s trivia questions wrong, the summoned opponents are much tougher than if you answer correctly. You can still get the bond with a wrong answer.
        You can also restart the quest without wheeling around by returning to the adventurer’s guild, abandoning the request and then taking it again. 

The correct answer to Endy's final question is "Nothing is more precious than life".

#### Requirements

- Attained [Guarda Fortress Abyss Good/True Ending](./greater-warped-one.md#good-ending) (needs confirmation).
- Liam (Alan and Lily's daughter) survives the ending.
- Hound companion survives.

!!! danger This request leads to a boss fight that is possibly very time-consuming and arguably more difficult than that of the average fight with the GWO of this abyss.

#### Walkthrough

1. After accepting the quest, head to Edge of Town to receive more information.
2. Head to **Zone 5 -Prehistoric Corridor B3F-** and seek out the dog and adventurers.

##### Enemies

**Boss: Offensive Golem**

Will buff itself with an attack + accuracy buff for 4 turns, and it will have the capacity to one shot even tanks that are defending. It will generally spam an AOE frontline attack, but can sometimes do a column attack. Very rarely, it will decide to basic attack. Every 4 turns, it will rebuff itself for another 4 turns.

**Boss: Defensive Golem**

It will buff itself on turn 1 with invulnerability (it will take 0 damage permanently). It also has the same moveset as the Offensive Golem in which it spams an AOE frontline attack or a column attack. It occasionally uses basic attacks. Every 4 turns, it will rebuff itself with the invulnerability (despite it having no duration).

##### Saving the Dog and Adventurers

If you choose to save both the dog and adventurers at the same time, you will need to fight BOTH, and the invulnerability buff of the defensive golem applies to the offensive golem (but not the other way around for the offensive buff). If you choose to save only either one, you will still need to fight both golems, but one at a time instead.

##### Strategy

^^Frontline:^^
Frontline preferably 3 Knights/Fighters/Priest (any combination) with 300+ DEF. Ideally they should have the skill Self-healing preferably at lvl 3, but no higher. It's also preferable to have entire inventories of Ultra Healing.

^^Backline:^^
Backline preferably 1 Priest, 1 opening-hitter DPS, 1 Ninja. Ninja and Priest are required, all 3 backline should have self-healing as well at lvl 1, any higher isnt necessary but lvl 3 is the highest you need.

^^Strategy:^^
If your team is fast enough, you have 1 turn to burn the defense golem for as much HP as possible in 1 turn. You need to use defense penetration skills or extremely high level skills, otherwise you will do nothing substantial. 

Once the golems buff, you must have the ninja use dissipation on the offensive golem. All units should defend at this point and wait for one of the golems to cause an opening. On average, the offensive golem hits for 200-250 to defending frontline without his damage buff.

Once an opening is created, have your backline opening-hitter do their strongest move against the golem. Every 4 turns, the golems will rebuff. You can tell when they are about to rebuff when the offensive golem has 1 turn of accuracy buff left. At this time it is safe to not defend with frontline and use Self-healing or Potions. This will keep MP costs down, but if you don't have a lot of MP, then it's okay to run another priest/mage with heals.

Repeat until both are dead. Use heals as often as possible. Makaltu might be worth using at low levels to reduce ur overall mp cost in the fight by a bit but it's not necessary, and you will die regardless if the offensive golem moves to the frontline and attacks with the damage buff up.

##### Notes

- If you only save the dog, you get nothing but the stated gold in the request.
- The quest is not repeatable once the bondmate has been obtained (Unsure if this is intended or not)

##### Rewards

- If you save both the dog and the adventurers, you will receive the bondmate "Eugen and Bibi" which is a void-type bondmate with confusion tolerance.
